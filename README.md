- 👋 Hi, I’m ZhiyuanLiu, one of general guy from 1.4 billion Chinese with common bachelor degree and master degree on processing.
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep learning. More specifically, adversarial attack and defence, graph neural network and anomaly detection via GNN. l love making experiment on unknown things, however, hate being exposed to unexplainness of neural network. What a contradictory person！！！
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on GNN network for anomaly detection. And start working on a fusion model idea for detection.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a chance for a Ph.D degree, for where Singapore, HongKong and Other Europe country are token into considered.
